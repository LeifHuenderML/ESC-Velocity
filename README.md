![ESC Velocity Logo](docs/imgs/logo.webp)

Welcome to ESC Velocity a health dashboard that is intended to cover all basis of health. Modern healthcare is not so modern we go into the doctor they check your blood pressure once and then perscribe you blood measure medications. This is such an archaic way of monitoring health. To truly understand our health we need to treat ourselfs as a gold mine of data. There are so many metrics that you can easily track with wearables, or by incorporating a couple tests as abpart of your daily routine. Our goal is about maximizing understanding on a personal basis. Health is a science of one in many ways unntil better methods are developed for deeper extrapolating results. Another main goal is automating as much as possible. There is not much value int trying to increaes your longetivity if you are spending all day taking measurements. I use a suite of handcrafted machine lerning models to sift through the data to try to avoid the common issues with most wellness apps (TIME). My personal regimen is 10 minutes in the morning to get data that cant be achieved otherways and 10 minutes in the evening. Everythigng esle if offloaded to wearables that send the data to the dashboard to then be analyzed. This is a messy large project and is meant to be hacked and tinkeered with my main goal is to keep things as modular so you can take what you want and leave what yout dont. 

To get the most straight forward setup you will need an apple watch, and some type of computer that is decently powerful enough to handle running prediction models antyhing about as strong as a mac m1 will suffice. Personally I used all inferencs on a nvidia rtx 4090.
